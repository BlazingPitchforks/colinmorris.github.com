title: "Conjunctive 'which' - a discourse marker on the rise?"
---

While grammarians have been retreading fuddy-duddy debates about *which* vs. *that* and restrictive clauses, *which* has been living a secret life. Which, how crazy is that?

Below are some examples I've collected. The usual roles of *which* (pronoun, determiner), can't easily account for these. My claim is that *which* is acting as a [discourse marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_marker). Some other examples of discourse markers in English are *and*, *so*, *you know*, *furthermore*, and *I mean*. Some key qualities of DMs (from [Schourup 1999](http://people.bu.edu/bfraser/Basic%20Introductory%20Readings/Schourup%20-%201999%20-%20DM%20-%20A%20Tuturial.pdf)) are that:

1. They signal some connection between the unit of discourse they introduce and some preceding unit of discourse
2. They can be removed from an utterance without affecting its truth-conditional meaning, or its grammaticality
3. They usually occur at the beginning of the discourse unit they mark
3. They have weak syntactic ties to their discourse unit

Schouroup also notes that "most forms claimed to be DMs occur primarily in speech... Association of a particular DM with the written or spoken channel is rarely strict and is often tied only to the relative formality/informality of the DM". *which* as DM definitely seems to be an informal construction. It was easy to find examples in places like Reddit and Twitter, and in corpora of spoken English, but very difficult to find any examples in books.

> I was paralyzed. I couldn’t write, **which** why don’t you just pull a plastic bag over my head and tie it around my neck.

(Perhaps we should say that, in cases such as this, *which* is acting as a conjunction, but not as a DM, because of the violation of rule #2 above. Removing *which* here does in fact render the host sentence ungrammatical - though it seems like the author could just as well have used a period or a dash in place of the comma.)

> REBECCA: and, I,  my worry is that they don't relate to what a woman feels when something like that is happening, because their experience would be totally different. If a man exposes himself, which, a man would never do that. Because, number one, they pick out, I think, more vulnerable people.


# What does it mean?

The pattern I see in these examples is that *which* introduces some commentary, reaction, or elaboration on the foregoing utterance. It virtually always seems to accompany some shift to a more author-centric voice, even in cases where the clause being introduced isn't conveying an opinion. 

Consider the first example from the Santa Barbara Corpus: 

> Um, Orville Havens. and uh his son. Which I can't remember his name. Starts with an el. Lenny or something.

We can't really call this commentary. Julie isn't giving a subjective opinion on Orville Havens' son, she's just giving some information about his name. But it's by way of describing *her own* memories. She's gone from describing some event in the world ("that was Havens [that] was taking it out"), to describing a belief that she holds about the world. While this version sounds okay:

> Which, I think his name was Lenny.  

I'd argue that removing the "I think" is enough to make it sound a bit weird:

> * Which, his name is Lenny.


# Where did it come from?

How did *which* get "pragmaticalized"? I have some ideas, but I should note at this point that this is the speculative hand-waving of a non-linguist.

Some of the examples above can be regarded as straightforward instances of *which* as a relative pronoun, made redundant by restating  its antecedent. Removing the NPs in square brackets in the examples below turns the *which* clause into a straightforward relative clause.


> Generally, installation failures can be fixed by running the same line again, which, yeah, **[that]**'s super janky, whatever. 

> this one ... guy was t- say it was like,  they got sent to the village. Which you don't wanna get sent to **[the village]**. But they do.

> because their experience would be totally different. If a man exposes himself, which, a man would never do **[that]**.

Others are harder to reshape this way. Take this sentence from the London Lund Corpus of Spoken English:

> this was a mysterious phrase, which, I knew perfectly well what it meant

Like before, we seem to have in "it" a restatement of the NP that *which* could or should refer to. But dropping "it" leaves us with something unparseable

> \* this was a mysterious phrase, which, I knew perfectly well what meant

The difficulty here seems to arise because the thing that *which* naturally refers to (the mysterious phrase), is neither the subject nor the object of the second clause. To get a proper relative clause out of this, we need to do some more extreme surgery, like:

> (1) this was a mysterious phrase, the meaning of which I knew perfectly well  
> (2) this was a mysterious phrase, whose meaning I knew perfectly well  
> (3) this was a mysterious phrase, which I knew perfectly well the meaning of

But all these options seem a little stilted in a conversational context. I think they also all fail to match the rhetorical force of "I knew perfectly well what that meant". 

By far the oldest example I was able to find of conjunctive-which, from an [1812 commentary on a Jacobean play](https://books.google.ca/books?id=21ArAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA189&dq=%22which+why%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhgruayf3NAhVK7YMKHa2sDgA4FBDoAQgzMAQ#v=onepage&q=%22which%20why%22&f=false), suffers from a similar dilemma:  

> This fine speech I have recovered from the folio of 1647, which why it should have been dropped, all but the first line, by the two last editors, I am at a loss to understand.

Again, turning this into a proper relative clause results in some really ugly periphrasis, like "the dropping of which... I am at a loss to understand". 

Maybe examples like this (where conjunctive *which* arises as the least-bad option when trying to construct a tricky relative clause), were the foot in the door that led to normalizing `<S> which <S>`, and leading to examples that seemingly have no relation to *which*-as-relativizer ("Which, okay."). But without any data to back it up, I don't have much conviction in this guess.

Why is *which* undergoing this shift but not the other English relativizers? I'm not sure. Here's an example of what might be called conjunctive "who" from a [2004 interview with wrestler "The Dirst Bike Kid"](http://www.wrestlezone.com/editorials/236527-on-the-ropes-an-interview-with-the-dirt-bike-kid):

> I am not 100% sure myself really, and don’t think I’ll ever really know the full-score. I understand that there was a lot of shit-stirring going on behind the scenes by some people, **who** I was eventually told by Phyllis Lee that it was the British guys on the tour that were creating trouble for me behind my back. I was unaware of this at the time.

But this seems to be much less common, and you could make the argument that this is just a speech error. 

# History

I was able to find precisely two previous references to this phenomenon, separated by almost 30 years. Remarkably, both are due to [Ronald Butters](https://english.duke.edu/people/ronald-r-butters), a professor of linguistics at Duke University. William Safire quotes Prof. Butters in [a 1983 column on regionalisms in American speech](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19830123&id=jZ9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5gUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6902,3729262&hl=en):

> [Southerners] often use the conjunctive which in a confusing way, according to Ronald Butters, who cites: “The President was not happy with the results of the election, which I couldn’t be happier about that”.

Then in 2009, someone sent [an inquiry](http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2009-January/086794.html) to the mailing list for the American Dialect Society, regarding this utterance from an interview on Good Morning America:

> I would often go down to the bar, sit up at the counter, drink a beer and talk about God, which, Jesus was accused of being a glutton and a drunkard.

Ron Butters [pipes up](http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2009-January/086795.html), suggesting it to be an instance of conjuctive *which*, and describing it as "a feature (rather startingly to my ears) of the speech of North Carolina (and doubtless other parts of the South)".

I'm surprised by the claim that this is a distinctly Southern phenomenon. I was raised in Southern Ontario, and the construction seems pretty natural to me. The tweets above include a couple authors from Georgia, but also authors from Portland, Toronto, and New York. Has its reach spread recently?

Above all, I was surprised to find no more than these two mentions, despite persistent Googling. This might just mean that I'm way off in interpreting this as a DM, and that this phenomenon has been more widely studied but under a different name. If you have any ideas, give me a shout!
