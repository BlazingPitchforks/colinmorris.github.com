title: "Conjunctive 'which' - a discourse marker on the rise?"
---

While grammarians have been retreading fuddy-duddy debates about *which* vs. *that* and restrictive clauses, *which* has been living a secret life. Which, how crazy is that?

Below are some examples I've collected. The usual roles of *which* (pronoun, determiner), can't easily account for these. My claim is that *which* is acting as a [discourse marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_marker). Some other examples of discourse markers in English are *and*, *so*, *you know*, *furthermore*, and *I mean*. Some key qualities of DMs (from [Schourup 1999](http://people.bu.edu/bfraser/Basic%20Introductory%20Readings/Schourup%20-%201999%20-%20DM%20-%20A%20Tuturial.pdf)) are that:

1. They signal some connection between the unit of discourse they introduce and some preceding unit of discourse
2. They can be removed from an utterance without affecting its truth-conditional meaning, or its grammaticality
3. They usually occur at the beginning of the discourse unit they mark
3. They have weak syntactic ties to their discourse unit

Schouroup also notes that "most forms claimed to be DMs occur primarily in speech... Association of a particular DM with the written or spoken channel is rarely strict and is often tied only to the relative formality/informality of the DM". *which* as DM definitely seems to be an informal construction. It was easy to find examples in places like Reddit and Twitter, and in corpora of spoken English, but very difficult to find any examples in books.

> I was paralyzed. I couldn’t write, **which** why don’t you just pull a plastic bag over my head and tie it around my neck.

(Perhaps we should say that, in cases such as this, *which* is acting as a conjunction, but not as a DM, because of the violation of rule #2 above. Removing *which* here does in fact render the host sentence ungrammatical - though it seems like the author could just as well have used a period or a dash in place of the comma.)

# What does it mean?

When I started writing this post, I thought I had discovered new linguistic territory, making the mistake of thinking that if something isn't on the internet, it doesn't exist. But in fact, The Dictionary of American Regional English gives three definitions of *which*-as-conjunction, starting with:

> 1. Used with a following anaphoric pronoun or pronomial adj or adv to form the equivalent of a non-restrictive relative pronoun or adv.

This definition (also described in [this 2003 Language Log post](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000118.html) - thanks to Mark Liberman for pointing it out) covers such examples as...


> Generally, installation failures can be fixed by running the same line again, which, yeah, **[that]**'s super janky, whatever.   

> this one ... guy was t- say it was like,  they got sent to the village. Which you don't wanna get sent to **[the village]**. But they do.  

> because their experience would be totally different. If a man exposes himself, which, a man would never do **[that]**.

Removing the bolded NPs above gives a normal relative clause.

The dictionary describes this construction as chiefly southern (which agrees with [this mention of conjunctive *which*](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19830123&id=jZ9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5gUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6902,3729262&hl=en) in a 1983 William Safire column, where it's described as a "confusing" Southern regionalism).

The other two definitions are:

> 2\. Used without an anaphoric pronoun as a connective particle to introduce a parenthetical, usu explanatory remark  
> 3\. also **and which**, **but which**; Used without an anaphoric pronoun to mark the connection of a clause or sentence to what precedes: and, and so, as to that.

Incidentally, 1 and 2 have corresponding OED glosses, but 3 does not. The OED flags them as '*\*\*\*\* Peculiar constructions*', and begins its version of #2 with "hence, in vulgar use...".

These cover the remaining examples, such as "which, are you serious?", or "Which, okay.". Though this is hardly surprising, given how broad these definitions are, particularly #3, which in some sense describes any discourse marker.

This is unsatisfying because it feels like there's more subtlety governing which clauses can be naturally linked up with "which". My sense is that all or most examples falling under #3 (the 'leftovers' which have no anaphoric pronoun and which aren't particularly parenthetical), could be described as giving the speaker's reaction to or commentary on the clause or sentence that immediately precedes.

This accords well with examples like "which, are you serious?", "which... why is he even in this conversation?", and "Which, okay.". 

I get the sense that conjunctive-*which* - particularly without an anaphoric pronoun - has gained popularity in the last 10 years or so, and that parenthetical/commentary *which* is a promising up-and-coming discourse marker. But I don't have any data to back that up. If I find some, I'll totally write another post about it.
