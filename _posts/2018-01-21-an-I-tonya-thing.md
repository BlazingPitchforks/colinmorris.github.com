I love the versatility of the word "thing" in colloquial English:

> <small>You know that thing where you repeat a word over and over until it just sounds like utter gibberish?</small>

> <small>he just sat in his car and ate [a whole thing of candy beans](http://breakalime.tumblr.com/post/19397181974/michael-was-filled-with-self-loathing-if-he-had)</small>

> <small>I can't go out tonight. I've got a thing.</small>

> <small>It’s kinda like in the movies where one person leaves right as the other person walks in like 2 minutes later kinda thing.</small>

> <small>She got a cough. She got it from Jean. And now [it's a whole thing with Jean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-QG-rFf4po).</small>

These usages all strike me as being pretty recent innovations.

Watching the film <i>I, Tonya</i>, a particular piece of *thing*-related dialogue stuck out to me as sounding a little too fresh for 1993:

> JEFF: I mean, girl skaters at this level. They're always messing with each other's skate blades. With each other's costumes.<br/>
> SHERIFF: I never knew that.<br/>
> JEFF: Yeah, it's a thing.

Mark Liberman wrote a nice [Language Log post](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=25229) on *a thing*, specifically its predicative use in phrases like "that's not even a thing", or "when did that become a thing?". <!--These usages turn on the existence of a phenomenon, in some sense. Does the thing you're describing really exist? Is this widely recognized as a legitimate thing? -->

Here are a few examples I found on Reddit, along with my attempts to paraphrase their meaning:

- [Is Zeus Support a thing? (/r/learndota2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/7fugxy/is_zeus_support_a_thing/). Is it considered legitimate/reasonable to play this character in this role? Is it something players are known to do?
- [Celebrities without eyebrows - apparently it's a thing (/r/funny)](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/6imjhf/celebrities_without_eyebrows_apparently_its_a/). Photoshopping photos of celebrities to erase their eyebrows is something that people do. Here is a page of Google image search results as evidence.
- [I just played against this opening. Is this actually a thing? (/r/chess)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/76rzuu/i_just_played_against_this_opening_is_this/). Is this a known strategy that players find success with?


So was *a thing* already a thing in 1993 when that *I, Tonya* scene was supposed to take place? 

In his Language Log post, the earliest example Mark was able to find was from 2004:

> I don’t think people in the rest of the country realize that when you’re a girl growing up in San Francisco, gay boys naturally comprise about 30 percent of your friend-base from the time you are in, like, 7th grade. It’s not even a thing. You don’t even think about it.

(Which is actually a bit of a puzzler. The speaker isn't denying that the phenomenon - girls in San Francisco having many gay friends - occurs. So is she instead saying that it's not *a thing* because it wasn't thought about or discussed? Or maybe this is closer to the "it's a whole thing with Jean" usage, where *thing* denotes a problem.)

Commenters pitched in with earlier sightings. Notably...

[An example from a 2000 forum post found by Adrian Riskin...](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=25229#comment-1512127):

> In regards to head shots, recs, etc. Before you go out and do this, check to see if this is even a thing at your school.

[From a 1997 interview found by January First-of-May](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=25229#comment-1512332):

> It's quite an episode; every time I'm there, it looks like a peacock exploded in his shop. It's all to serve as a contrast to what Bob does, and it's become a thing now. People expect you to wear it, even when you're not on the show. And you can't wear that in public.

But I think I have them all beat. Turning to the [Corpus of Contemporary American English](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/), I was able to find a pretty unambiguous example dating back to 1993, from an episode of Rush Limbaugh's radio show:

> LIMBAUGH: (Voiceover) Well, I was perplexed by this because as you people know, as a powerful influential member of the media, I fly quite a bit. And I've been on airplanes, especially American flights, and I've seen male flight attendants. Now I don't know how many of those male flight attendants are male lesbians -- you know... (Laughter) **Well, it's a thing.** I mean, there's a -- it's a -- there's a feminist professor down in Tampa who's discovered a male lesbian -- it's ra -- it's a woman victimized by creation trapped in the body of a man and she's trying to -- so you never know how many males are male lesbians. But we found at American Airlines, 15 to 20 percent of those flight attendants are men. 

However, of the 22 instances I was able to find in COCA, all but 2 occurred after 2010, and half occurred in the last 2 years. Some Language Log commenters pointed out that this usage was common on 30 Rock (indeed, I was able to find [two](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/49a35a99-1636-4cb9-abda-8872f987026e) different [instances](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/3ff4a4ff-8732-4fa5-875e-8ecf2d786df1) of it in a single episode from 2012), which seems like a plausible vector for its entry into the mainstream.

So sure, Tonya Harding's ex-husband *might* have used this idiom in 1993, but it would have put him on the bleeding edge of linguistic trends (along with Rush Limbaugh).
