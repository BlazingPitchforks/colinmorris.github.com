I'd like to nominate [this](http://ait08.us.es/cgi-bin/man/man2html?xjack+6) for Best Man Page Ever. 

If you're curious what it actually does, xjack is an xscreensaver hack that types Jack Torrance's famous mantra on the screen, including erratic spacing and typos (just like in the film - nice touch!). 

Like most xscreensaver hacks, it was written by [Jamie Zawinski](http://www.jwz.org/) who, all evidence suggests, is a pretty cool guy.
