I find it ironic that [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) a system for *creating documentation* (it powers GitHub's wikis) has some of the worst documentation I've seen. They have

* A [README.md](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/blob/master/README.md)
* A [wiki](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki) with **2 pages**, [one of which](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Sdw-Test) has title "Sdw Test" and body "This is a test.".
* A [docs directory](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/tree/master/docs) with **1 page** written 3 years ago.

That's it. So good luck if you want to do something ridiculously simple like use GitHub Flavored Markdown instead of vanilla.
