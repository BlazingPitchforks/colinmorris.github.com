My name is Colin Morris. I just finished my Master's in computer science at the University of Toronto. My [thesis](http://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/gh/Morris,Colin-MSc-thesis-2013.pdf) was on detecting online sexual predators using machine learning techniques with linguistic features. I love Python and Linux and pop music (wanna be my friend on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/UnicornTurds)?).

Thanks for stopping by. If you'd like to contact me, my e-mail is:
