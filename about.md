I'm an unemployed programmer and deep learning enthusiast. Currently working on some kooky personal projects involving machine learning and data visualization, which I plan to share here (and on my Github: {% include icon-github.html username="colinmorris" %}).

I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2013 with a Master's in CS. From 2013-2016, I worked at Apple on the "Proactive Siri" team.
